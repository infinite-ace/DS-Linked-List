# Linked list

## What is a linked list
It is a linear collection of values whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next


## Things to implement

1. Implement insertion
2. Implement Deletion
3. Implement Update
4. Implement GetByIndex
5. Implement GetByValue
6. Implement PrintAllValues method

## Actions based on your implementations

1. Reverse the link list (how to traverse it backwards)
2. Make the singly linked list, doubly linked

## Benchmarking

1. Write benchmarks for the different types of actions your Linked List could make using the following structure
